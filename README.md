<strong>Project Title: Tic Tac Toe Game</strong>

<strong>Description:</strong>

In this project, I built a Tic Tac Toe game that runs in the browser. I started by developing the core game logic and then moved on to implementing the user interface with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal was to create a working game with minimal global code by using objects and modular design patterns.

<strong>Technologies Used:</strong>

<ul>
  <li><strong>HTML:</strong> Structured the game interface.</li>
  <li><strong>CSS:</strong> Styled the game elements.</li>
  <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Implemented the game logic and DOM manipulation.</li>
  <li><strong>Git:</strong> Managed version control for the project.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Features:</strong>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Gameboard:</strong> A data structure to hold the state of the game.</li>
  <li><strong>Player Objects:</strong> Represented players and their markers.</li>
  <li><strong>Game Logic:</strong> Determined win conditions and game flow.</li>
  <li><strong>Display Controller:</strong> Updated the DOM based on the game state.</li>
  <li><strong>User Interface:</strong> Allowed players to interact with the game, enter names, and restart the game.</li>
  <li><strong>Test Game Logic:</strong> I ensured the game works correctly in the browser. I tested for win conditions, ties, and valid/invalid moves.</li>
  <li><strong>Refine Display and Functionality:</strong> I improved styling and user interaction, added features like displaying player names, and a restart button.</li>
</ul>
